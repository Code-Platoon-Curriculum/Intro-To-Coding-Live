A script that cannot handle changes in environment or input data is known to be __brittle__.  Flexible scripts, on the other hand, are written in a way that a variety of data will not break the script and cause unknown errors.  If the input data is highly controlled, a brittle script would be appropriate, but keeping code flexible is usually the ideal method.\n",

At Code Platoon, we focus on Python and Javascript since they are the most popular languages behind full-stack applications.  \n",

A variable name in Python will typically be a lowercase word or series of words separated by the underscore character (`_`).

Below is some code blocks that are written with hard-coded values and an improved version below it replaced with appropriately named variables.  Even without adding comments, the code written with programmatic principles in mind is easier to read. It is also easier to change.

    "\n",
    "As a software developer, your daily grind involves tackling a myriad of puzzles. Whether youâ€™re part of an application development team or working on your own project, problem-solving is at the core of what we do. Software engineeers are builders and the traditional end goal is to build a functional applicationâ€”the grand challenge that takes months to crack. Building it can be defined as one big problem to solve, but that one problem contains hundreds or even thousands of smaller problems that we have to address. Take authentication, for instance. Let's say you are creating a module that validates user credentials to let them log-in. Sounds simple, right? Yet beneath the surface lie a cascade of smaller problems: data types, formatting, comparisons, validation, etc.  How can we address all of them in the right way?  That is where these techniques come into play."
